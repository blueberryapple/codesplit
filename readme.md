## what is this
this is an example of a webpack config with multiple entry points. the point is to demonstrate the abilities of dynamic imports, we see that there are two seperate modules and that one of them dynamically imports a dependency five seconds in. this is achieved by breaking up the folktale dependency. this allows us to load it at our own leisure, this causes the initial load time of an application to be much quicker. also, by breaking up the dependencies like so, we are able to reuse them among the different modules without duplicate network requests for the same dependency.
